# Allure Integration in CSTestFramework

## 1. Overview
Allure is integrated into the framework to provide rich, interactive test reports with detailed test execution information, screenshots, logs, and environment details.

## 2. Key Components

### 2.1 Configuration Files

#### Root Configuration (allureConfig.json)
Location: /CSTestFramework/allureConfig.json
Purpose: Main configuration file for Allure reporting

This is a configuration file for Allure reporting. It controls various aspects of how your Allure reports are generated and displayed. Let's break down its key sections:

1. **Directory Configuration**:
```json
"directory": "allure-results"
```
- Specifies where Allure should store test results (in your case, `allure-results` directory)

2. **Link Templates**:
```json
"links": [
  {
    "type": "issue",
    "urlTemplate": "https://example.com/issues/{}"
  },
  {
    "type": "tms",
    "urlTemplate": "https://example.com/test-cases/{}"
  }
]
```
- Defines templates for linking to external systems:
  - Issue tracking system links
  - Test Management System (TMS) links
- These allow you to link test cases to your issue tracker or test management system

3. **Test Categories**:
```json
"categories": [
  {
    "name": "Failed tests",
    "matchedStatuses": ["failed"]
  },
  // ... other categories
]
```
- Defines how tests are categorized in the report based on their status
- Helps organize test results into meaningful groups (Failed, Broken, Ignored, Unknown)

4. **Executor Information**:
```json
"executors": [
  {
    "name": "CSTestFramework",
    "type": "nunit",
    "url": "https://github.com/your-org/CSTestFramework",
    // ... other executor details
  }
]
```
- Provides information about the test execution environment
- Includes details about the build, CI/CD system, and links to related resources

5. **Environment Settings**:
```json
"environment": {
  "Browser": "Chrome",
  "Browser.Version": "120.0",
  "Stand": "Production",
  "OS": "Windows",
  "OS.Version": "10.0.19045"
}
```
- Default environment values
- Note: These are overridden by the actual values collected during test execution (which is why you see "Unknown" in your `environment.properties`)

6. **Attachment Settings**:
```json
"attachments": {
  "maxSize": 10485760
}
```
- Controls attachment handling (e.g., maximum file size for screenshots, logs, etc.)

7. **Report Customization**:
```json
"report": {
  "title": "CSTestFramework Test Report",
  "description": "Comprehensive test automation framework report",
  "logo": "https://example.com/logo.png",
  "theme": "default"
}
```
- Customizes the appearance and metadata of the generated report

### Important Notes:

1. This file serves as a template/default configuration. Some values (like environment info) are dynamically updated during test execution.

2. The configuration in this file is used by the Allure framework when generating the HTML report from the test results.

3. You also have `allureConfig.Template.json` files in different project folders (API.Tests, Core, UI.Tests) which might be used as templates for specific test types.

4. The URLs in your config (like `https://example.com`) are placeholder values that should be updated to match your actual systems.

### Recommendation:

1. Update the URLs in the config to point to your actual systems:
   - Issue tracking system
   - Test management system
   - CI/CD build links
   - Report URLs

2. Consider customizing the report section with your actual:
   - Project logo
   - Report title
   - Description

#### Template Configurations (allureConfig.Template.json)
Locations:
- /API.Tests/allureConfig.Template.json
- /Core/allureConfig.Template.json
- /UI.Tests/allureConfig.Template.json
Purpose: Project-specific Allure configuration templates
Usage: Serve as starting points for project-specific Allure configurations
